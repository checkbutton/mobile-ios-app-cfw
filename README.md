### Problem Statement
Currently, there is no visibility for ranking and scores of participants from CrossFit Werk. In order to encourage motivation / competition, it is important to surface the Open's score to all participants.
### Assumptions for the Challenge
Participants scores are recorded by CFW however, there is no medium to surface this information.
### Hypothesis
I believe that providing a score chart of participants will result in increase completion rate and higher scores because I think that it will increase motivation and competitive spirit.
### How to measure success
* [Primary metric] Overall completion of participants who signed up for the challenge
* [Secondary metric] Increase in average score of the class
### Solution
Show list of participants with the most important information that will validate the hypothesis (name, score, rank).
### Technical Solution
Technology: `iOS`
Language: `Swift`
